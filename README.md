## Status

Project is _expansionable_.

That means it is finished and I like how it works. But I am open to any issues connected to it (such as bug fix or adding new features in the long long future).

## Why did I create it

The first version I made was using bad library for animations and has no graphic interface and because I like fractals so much I decided to reacreate it using better solution: [SFML.NET](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml.net/) library.
